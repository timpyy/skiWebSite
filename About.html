      <p>Tim is a senior studying Music Technology and Computer Science. Although he is born and raised in a country that sees no snow, Tim has developed an obsession with this fluffy white powder that falls from the sky. After every major snowstorm, you can often spot him diving head-first into deep powdery snow on the streets of the East Village.</p>

      <p>Joanna likes to snowboard. She likes it so much she competed for British Columbia's freestyle team at one point, but then almost died (inquire inside for details) so she came to school to study business and psychology. She still snowboards despite brain damage and has taken up running where her head is safe from hard surfaces. She is also a CASI certified snowboard instructor and worked on a skate/snow shop so feel free to ask her for questions on anything snow related.</p>
